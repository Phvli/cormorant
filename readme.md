# Cormorant

Cormorant is an ECS game engine and OpenGL renderer experiment I did back in 2017. Fly around with a joystick, fire missiles and view the airplane from different angles. Seems to distract visiting, over-energetic kids just fine.
Note that while this compiles, it will require some data files (models, textures) not present in this repository. Open a PR if you need those.
